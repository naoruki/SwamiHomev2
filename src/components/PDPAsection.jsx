        Sunshine Welfare Action Mission (SWAMI Home) respects the privacy of all
        our residents, clients, employees, donors and business contacts and is
        committed to protecting the personal information provided to us. PDPC
        made Amendments to PDPA which take effect from 1 February 2021. The
        Amendments will strengthen Organisational accountability and consumer
        protection while giving Organisations the confidence to harness personal
        data for innovation. It is our policy to comply with the requirements of
        PDPA Act 2012 and the guidelines issued by PDPC of Singapore from time
        to time.
