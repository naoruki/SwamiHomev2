        <h3>Words of Spiritual Founder</h3>

        <h4>Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba</h4>
      </center>
      <p>
        Serve society, help the poor and needy in distress and thus manifest the
        human quality of compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
        By doing selfless service to mankind, you are doing service to God.
        Deserve the grace of God by helping the weak and poor, the diseased and
        the disabled, the distressed and the downtrodden. Selfless service must
        be directed towards the removal of physical distress, the alleviation of
        mental agony and the fulfillment of spiritual yearning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Selfless service can be identified by means of two basic
        characteristics: compassion and willingness to sacrifice. Let every
        action of yours be a prayer to God. Consider every good work as God’s
        work. Be firmly convinced that what you are doing is something sacred.
        In service, there is nothing good or bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever requires to be done to serve anyone, at any time, in any form –
        you should do without hesitation. The selfless service that you do,
        should not be done out of a sense of compulsion or to please others. It
        should be wholehearted and spontaneous. Develop forbearance, patience,
        peace and love and you carry on your work. This is your true spiritual
        discipline. Face whatever problems that may arise with faith and courage
        and carry out the service activities without fanfare, in a spirit of
        humility and dedication.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many who come forward when there is a call for social service,
        but most of them crave publicity seeking the camera whenever they help
        others and very disappointed when they are not mentioned in the
        newspapers. Such persons push themselves forward and climb into
        positions of authority, just to parade their importance before the
        public. They forget that service is worship, that each act of service is
        a flower placed at the feet of the Lord and that, if the act is tainted
        with ego, it is as if the flower is infested with slimy insect pests.
        You should love all and serve all. You should have no distinction of
        caste or creed or religion. There is absolutely no room for any
        separatist feelings. You should see the essence of all religions as
        same. You should foster feelings of brotherhood and consider all as
        brothers and sisters of the same family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of saying a hundred things, it is better to do one thing
        properly. Sanctify your life by doing selfless work. For the person who
        talks a lot, there is no time for work. For the person who is engaged in
        work, there is no time to talk. Instead of wasting time in words, use
        your time in service to mankind which is service to God, all the while
        repeating the name of the Lord on your lip
      </p>
